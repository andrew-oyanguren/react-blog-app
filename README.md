## Project Overview

This project uses React Redux to manage multiple state slices from user authentication, form validation, sideDrawer states etc. I created custom hooks for form inputs, http requests, and window object hooks to implement scroll behavior on the header background and create a responsive navbar. Lastly I used styled components to create a theme, resusable mixins, and to set global styling all which are located in the styles folder.

## Key Takeaways

I am currently still building out this app, and will be updating it as I go. The point was not to make a pretty application here, but to focus on the logic and use of react hooks with redux.
